# Project Overview

Tutor hop is a website where UMass students can easily search for, select and contact tutors that tutor in their area. It will be designed to be a personal hub for all tutor related information. It will hold the locations and times of tutoring classes and easily allow students and tutors to organise their schedules. Tutors can also use this platform to advertise their services and manage their timetables too.
